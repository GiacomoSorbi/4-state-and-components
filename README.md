React Introduction

## Installation

Clone this repository and use `npm start` in your terminal to make it start

## Activities and Objectives

You are tasked to add an input field to your Container component.

The input field should be on top of it, receive a value and pass it as a `circles` props (from the previous exercise) to the `Container` component.

Does it change the number of circles when you input a new value if you just change the value of the `circles` prop?

What happens if you instead change its state and then use it to pass the value of `circles`?

Examples:

```
// later
```

## Extra notes and tips

Remember that React.js behaves differently from other tools like Angular and once a component is rendered, it is not supposed to change until the `render()` method is triggered again.

How would you proceed, now?
